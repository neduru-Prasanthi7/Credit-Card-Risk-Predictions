## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked for **null values**
- Removed rows containing null values

✔️ *Ensures clean and reliable input data*

---

### 2️⃣ Missing Value Handling
- Identified **missing values**
- Handled missing values using **random sampling techniques**

✔️ *Prevents data loss and preserves data distribution*

---

### 3️⃣ Outlier Detection & Treatment
- Checked for **outliers** in numerical features
- Handled and removed extreme values

✔️ *Improves model stability and accuracy*

---

### 4️⃣ Feature Selection
- Removed **irrelevant and less important columns**
- Selected only useful features for prediction

✔️ *Reduces noise and improves model performance*

---

### 5️⃣ Data Balancing
- Balanced the dataset to handle **class imbalance**

✔️ *Prevents model bias towards majority class*

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

All cleaned and balanced data was trained on multiple models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression ⭐
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost

✔️ *Each model was trained and tested independently*
